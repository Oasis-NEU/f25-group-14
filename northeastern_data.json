Throughout its years as an established student organization, NU Barkada has grown to become a bigger family than its founders had ever imagined. However, the organization still holds true to the guidelines and values set forth by its founders, and continues to build upon their strong foundation. \"Barkada\" is a word from the one of the main Filipino languages, Tagalog, which means \"group of friends.\" We embrace each and every one of our members as not only friends, but family, as well. NU Barkada's logo, from one aspect, resembles the Nipa Hut, a bamboo shelter built in the rural, coastal areas of the Philippines.

The logo also resembles two people, hand-in-hand, dancing Tinikling, a Filipino cultural dance.

Whether you want to sharpen your technical interview skills, compete among hundreds of collegiate teams worldwide, or simply just chill and make friends while you solve Leetcode-style problems, HCPC welcomes coders of all skill levels!   The gist of competitive programming is basically solving problems fast. \"Fast\" is both in the sense of algorithmic efficiency (big O) and in the sense of problem solving speed. That may sounds daunting but don't worry. We aim to provide an iterative learning process via informative workshops and practical contests to teach you the skills and techniques needed to succeed.   If competitions are your jam, we send several teams each year to compete in ICPC - the International Collegiate Programming Contest, where competitions are held at a qualifying, regional, divisional, national, and international level. Each contest consists of teams of 3 working together to solve a set of challenging problems in a set amount of time. Overall, it's an intense time but a fantastic experience. If you're looking for more competitions, websites such as CodeForces, USACO, and Hackerrank provide contests that we may occasionally take an interest in as well.   If you aren't interested in competitions, that's fine too! The skills you learn through our contests and workshops is not only applicable to competitions, but also technical interviews and coding challenges. We invite you to come to our internal contests where you can make friends and brainstorm with others to solve challenging problems. In addition, our workshops aim to provide knowledge on various CP topics such as prefix sums, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.   So come through to HCPC!

One major setback that international students face when coming to study in the US, is the uncertainty of having viable job prospects in the US after graduation due to the Visa/Work Permit issue. Currently, US college graduates without a STEM major get 12 months of OPT and STEM students a total of 29 months. After this period, students must hope that companies will sponsor them for an H-1B visa, which very few companies do and these companies are also difficult to find. Additionally, the club also hopes to offer guidance to international student on how to be successful as internationals in the professional world, and how they should be able to utilize their skills to their advantage.   Strategy: We hope to have our club consist of two components. The first component would be to have a research division to the club. The researchers would have the responsibility of researching & contacting companies for positions that offer sponsorship or offer to hire international students. In the long run we would hopefully be able to build relationships with these companies where we can hopefully send an international student every year to work there. The findings of our research will be available to all our members and we would also encourage members to have a genuine crowdsourcing mentality, where if they find a position that does not require sponsorship, that they share it with the rest of the group members. Alternatively, we would also like to bring in guest speakers, in a group discussion setting, to give members the opportunity to talk and discuss on how to be successful international professionals. Researchers and Eboard members in our club would also be responsible for reach out to potential guest speakers.   Objectives: The three objectives we have are Place & Educate & Serve. We want to place as much of our international members into secure jobs after graduation. We want to educate the international student body on how they are able to be global leaders by bringing in proven professionals in an array of fields to offer advice and guidance. Lastly, it is also important to serve. This is done by researchers in the club and general members sharing jobs that they have found that do not require sponsorships to all other members of the club.

The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service. The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive we”. From its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, they held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity’s motto, “Culture For Service and Service For Humanity”. Today, Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an international organization of leaders. No longer a single entity, members of the Fraternity have been instrumental in the establishment of the Phi Beta Sigma National Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club Foundation.

We've formed the Huskies Organizing with Labor (HOWL) in support of dining workers.

HOWL was able to organize enough student support to pressure Northeastern to agree to demands a day before workers were planning to strike. In 2022, the dining workers' contract was up for renewal again, and we supported HOWL and the workers in their organizing. In the end, improved wages, healthcare benefits, and other conditions were won, just before a strike was likely to happen. We have also organized with Full-Time Non-Tenure Track (FTNTT) Faculty. Northeastern administration has now twice denied their right to a free and fair election to unionize.
